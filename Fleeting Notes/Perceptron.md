##### Biological Neuron vs Perceptron

![[AI - Perceptron - Neuron vs Perceptron.png]]

Perceptrons are weakly similar to neurons, drawing inspiration from its structural design.

<u>Differences</u>
1. Neurons are more complex
2. Neurons use different type of processing
3. Neuroplasticity

> [!tip] Interpretation of Weights
> Imply feature importance in decision making

#####  Geometric Intuition

- Perception is a ==binary classifier== that gives a line/hyperplane seperating two regions representing two classes of output.

> [!danger] Limitation
> Perceptron only works for linear datasets
