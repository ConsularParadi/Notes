##### Intelligence and its correlation with AI :-
1) Remember the past. Learn from it.
	• Memory and experience – case based reasoning.
	• Learn a model – machine learning.
	• Recognise objects, faces, patterns – deep neural networks.
2) Understand the present. Be aware of the world around you.
	• Create a model of the world – knowledge representation.
	• Make inferences from what you know – logic and reasoning.
3) Imagine the future. Work towards your goals.
	• Trial and error – heuristic search.
	• Goals, plans, and actions – automated planning.
